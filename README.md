**Turn a rough objective into a model-specific prompt that actually works — then prove it.**

Proofhouse is a PromptOps framework for builders who care about *which* model runs the job, not just *what* you asked. Natural language in → batched clarification → optimized prompt out → self-heal when it misses. Built-in profiles for **September 2026 frontier models**, token discipline, loop engineering for recurring agents, and an offline eval harness — no API keys required for the certified headless path.

## Why Proofhouse exists

Generic prompts fail quietly: wrong model assumptions, missing context, no stop conditions, no regression tests. Proofhouse treats prompts like production infrastructure:

| Stage | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Clarify** | One upfront batch of branching questions — not drip-feed back-and-forth |
| **Compile** | Model-specific prompt + settings + token-saving rationale |
| **Evaluate** | JSONL cases, YAML rubrics, stdlib CLI validation |
| **Self-heal** | Diagnose scope/tone/bloat/model-mismatch and revise without losing history |

Designed for coding agents, Custom GPTs, Cursor skills, and cyber×AI workflows where inventing facts or skipping safety boundaries is unacceptable.

## Supported models (framework v1.3)

Built-in `modelNotes` — prompting quirks, API ids, cost/caching levers:

| Tier | Models |
|---|---|
| **Anthropic** | Claude Fable 5.1 · Mythos 5.1 · Opus 5 · Sonnet 5 · Haiku 4.5 |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-5.6 Sol · Terra · Luna |
| **Google** | Gemini 3.8 Flash |
| **xAI** | Grok 4.6 |
| **Meta** | Muse Spark 1.3 |
| **Moonshot** | Kimi K3 |
| **Legacy** | Fable 5 · Mythos 5 · Opus 4.8 · GPT-5.5 · Gemini (generic) |
| **Other** | Auto-research via web search, cached for reuse |

## Three ways to use it

### 1. Conversational (default)

Install the Cursor skill from `skills/proofhouse/` or invoke **Proofhouse** in chat:

1. State your objective and target model
2. Answer one batched clarification form
3. Paste the compiled prompt; say what's wrong to self-heal

### 2. Interactive artifact

Open [`apps/proofhouse.jsx`](apps/proofhouse.jsx) — a React artifact with model picker, efficiency modes, and live compile loop. This artifact calls `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` and is not offline.

### 3. Offline compiler (reproducible)

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
python -m pytest
proofhouse-compiler doctor
proofhouse-compiler closed-loop path/to/requirements.json --repair-budget 1 --json
```

Approved headless profiles: `structured_minimal_v0`, `structured_developer_v0`. Certified path is **offline** (fake adapter, no network). `proofhouse-compiler execute-openai` is fail-closed **opt-in** live OpenAI and is **not** certified. No benchmark claims.

## 30-second start

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
python -m pytest
python -m proofhouse.cli validate --dataset evals/datasets/prompt_audit_cases.jsonl
python -m proofhouse.cli report --dataset evals/datasets/prompt_audit_cases.jsonl --out evals/reports/prompt_audit_report.md
```

## What you get

| Capability | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Meta-optimizer | Clarify → compile → self-heal with model-specific behavior |
| Token discipline | Efficient / Balanced / Thorough presets; cache-aware prompt structure |
| Loop engineering | Trigger, body, exit, escalation, compounding memory for recurring agents |
| Prompt architecture | Core prompt, modes, modules, project context templates |
| Audits | Missing-context labels, safety boundaries, rewrite notes |
| Agentic design | Permission maps, tool boundaries, verification loops, stop conditions |
| Evals | JSONL datasets, YAML rubrics, schema checks, report skeletons |
| Skill pack | Cursor skill + portable `proofhouse-framework.*` |

## Repository map

```text
proofhouse-framework.*   Portable meta-optimizer spec (v1.3 model profiles)
skills/proofhouse/       Cursor skill bundle + artifact JSX
apps/proofhouse.jsx      Interactive compile UI
prompts/                Core, modes, modules, Custom GPT pack
evals/                  JSONL datasets, YAML rubrics
src/proofhouse/          Stdlib eval harness + headless compiler
tests/fixtures/         Contract schemas and validation fixtures
```

## Design rules

- Stay lightweight by default; tighten only for safety, agentic execution, or missing context.
- Never invent repository or project facts.
- Use exact missing-context labels: `UNKNOWN`, `NOT SPECIFIED`, `NOT FOUND IN PROVIDED MATERIAL`.
- Keep cybersecurity and sensitive-data work defensive, authorized, and privacy-preserving.
- No private chain-of-thought dumps — concise rationales only.

## Engineering status

Proofhouse ships two products in one repo:

1. **PromptOps skill + framework (v1.3)** — conversational meta-optimizer with current frontier model profiles. This is the user-facing surface most people want today.
2. **Headless compiler** — contract-first offline pipeline under `src/proofhouse/compiler/`. Requirements compiler maturity remains `PARTIAL`. Certified path is **offline** (fake adapter, no network). `proofhouse-compiler execute-openai` is fail-closed **opt-in** live OpenAI and is **not** certified. `hosted-*` / `missionrig-*` are experimental library slices, not a hosted UI (DFR-006/008). `apps/proofhouse.jsx` calls the Anthropic Messages API when run as a Claude artifact and is **not** the certified path. No benchmark claims.

Internal mission reports and review corpora are not published in this repository.
