# Proofhouse Framework

A meta prompt-optimizer: natural language in, a model-specific optimized prompt out, with
branching clarification and a self-heal refinement loop. Portable spec — usable as an
interactive artifact, dropped into a new project, or run manually in conversation.

---

## How it works

1. **Input** — user states an objective in plain language, names a target model/provider, and
   picks a token-efficiency mode (Efficient / Balanced / Thorough).
2. **Clarify** — a single upfront batch of grouped questions, with conditional follow-ups
   that only appear when a prior answer opens that path (branching, not one-at-a-time —
   deliberately designed for models that aren't well suited to rapid back-and-forth). The
   number of questions asked scales with the chosen efficiency mode.
3. **Compile** — synthesizes the optimized prompt for that specific model, with a short
   rationale, suggested settings (effort level, temperature, etc. as applicable), and an
   explicit account of the token-saving choices made. Adds a Security & Reliability section
   automatically if the request touches software/infra/data handling.
4. **Self-heal** — if the result isn't right, feedback is diagnosed (scope mismatch, wrong
   tone, missing constraint, too rigid, too vague, model mismatch, security gap, token
   bloat/too verbose, other) and a revised version is produced. Prior versions stay accessible.

## Token efficiency system

Two separate things are kept lean: Proofhouse's own API usage, and the compiled prompt it
hands back. Neither claim is "magic" — both are ordinary, verifiable engineering choices:

- **A universal token-discipline directive** is injected into every call Proofhouse makes. It
  instructs the model to cut redundant framing, merge overlapping constraints into single
  directives, never restate already-established information, and default to the shortest
  phrasing that preserves meaning. For Claude targets, it also asks the compiled prompt to
  separate stable/reusable instructions from per-call variable content, so the user can apply
  prompt caching on their end.
- **An efficiency mode** (Efficient / Balanced / Thorough) scales both the number of
  clarifying questions asked (6-10 / 10-16 / 14-22) and the word cap on the compiled prompt
  itself (250 / 500 / 800 words) — the biggest lever for reducing tokens is asking fewer,
  better-chosen questions and producing a tighter final prompt, not compressing wording after
  the fact.
- **A visible token estimate** (`~N tokens (est.)`, computed locally as `chars / 4`, no extra
  API call) is shown next to every compiled prompt so efficiency is something you can check,
  not just something you're told.
- **Token bloat is a named self-heal category** — if a compiled prompt feels wasteful, saying
  so routes to the same diagnosis-and-revise loop as any other complaint.

This is deliberate, measurable token discipline — not a claim that it's unlike anything else,
which isn't a verifiable thing to assert about a prompting technique.

## Model notes (update as models change)

<!-- model-notes:begin -->
| Model | Verified | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Fable 5.1** | 2026-09-03 | Long-horizon / science / unattended runs. 1M context, 128k output (`claude-fable-5-1`), thinking always on (disabled returns 400), default effort high, $10/$50, slower than Opus 5. State goals and success criteria, not steps -- over-specifying degrades it. Cyber + bio classifiers remain; life-sciences R&D is redirected to Opus 5 or Mythos 5.1 trusted access. Never ask it to echo/explain hidden reasoning as response text. Define explicit pause-vs-continue checkpoints for long tasks. Reach for it when Opus 5 at higher effort still fails evals. |
| **Claude Mythos 5.1** | 2026-09-03 | Same model as Fable 5.1, with looser cyber/bio safeguards, restricted to trusted-org programs (CVP / LSVP). Same prompting patterns as Fable 5.1. |
| **Claude Opus 5** | 2026-09-03 | Anthropic's default for complex agentic coding. 1M context, 128k output (`claude-opus-5`), thinking on by default (disable only at effort high or below), default effort high, $5/$25. Give the full task spec and let it run -- it finishes rather than stubbing. Strip verify/self-check/subagent-QA instructions (they cause over-verification). Cap subagent spawns; it delegates eagerly. Ask for concise progress explicitly; default replies run long. Constrain scope on large jobs or it will expand them. Step up to Fable 5.1 only when Opus 5 at higher effort still fails evals. |
| **Claude Sonnet 5** | 2026-09-03 | Fast, capable default. Concise, direct instructions; doesn't need heavy scaffolding. Good for genuine iteration. |
| **Claude Haiku 4.5** | 2026-09-03 | Optimized for speed/cost. Keep prompts narrow; break multi-stage work into smaller discrete requests. |
| **GPT-5.6 Sol** | 2026-09-03 | Flagship GPT-5.6 (`gpt-5.6-sol`; the `gpt-5.6` alias routes here). Outcome, constraints, evidence, and completion bar -- not step lists. Lean system prompts; strip repeated rules and unused examples. More concise than 5.5 by default -- skip blanket 'be concise'; control length with `text.verbosity`. Define autonomy/approval bounds (it is proactive on multi-step work). `reasoning.effort` default medium; high/xhigh only when evals gain; reserve max. Personality vs collaboration as separate short blocks. Programmatic Tool Calling only for bounded reduction of large tool results, not every tool loop. Keep reusable prefixes stable for prompt caching. |
| **GPT-5.6 Terra** | 2026-09-03 | Balanced GPT-5.6 default for most apps (`gpt-5.6-terra`). Same prompting contract as Sol: outcome-first, lean prompts, `text.verbosity`, explicit autonomy bounds. Prefer Terra over Sol unless hard reasoning, coding, or tool coordination fails evals. Same 1M context / 128k output family. Start `reasoning.effort` at medium and test one step lower before stepping up. |
| **GPT-5.6 Luna** | 2026-09-03 | Fast/cheap GPT-5.6 (`gpt-5.6-luna`). Same family prompting patterns, but keep the task narrow. Best for classification, extraction, transformation, and batch work with automated validation -- not high-error-cost agentic coding unless evals hold. Same verbosity/effort/caching levers as Sol/Terra; default effort medium and prefer `none`/`low` when quality holds. |
| **GPT-5.5** | 2026-09-03 | Legacy. Explicit system/developer instructions, clear output format, few-shot examples for style-sensitive output. Prefer the GPT-5.6 family unless a workload is pinned here. |
| **Gemini 3.8 Flash** | 2026-09-03 | Google workhorse (`gemini-3.8-flash`), 1M context, 65k output, intro $0.75/$3.75. Reasoning model -- concise direct instructions; legacy CoT scaffolding hurts. Control depth with `thinking_level` (low/medium/high), not temperature/top_p (ignored on 3.x). Put instructions after large context; anchor with 'Based on the preceding information...'. Higher effort uses more tokens by design. Separate stable system instructions from per-call variable content for caching. Add 2026 date + Jan 2025 knowledge-cutoff clauses for time-sensitive or strictly grounded tasks per Google docs. |
| **Grok 4.6** | 2026-09-03 | xAI frontier (`grok-4.6`), 500K context, image+text in, reasoning low/medium/high (default)/xhigh, $2/$6 per MTok below 200K prompt tokens (entire request doubles above 200K). Agentic coding and long-horizon work -- outcome-first with explicit stop/approval bounds. Set `prompt_cache_key` or `x-grok-conv-id` for cache affinity on multi-turn loops. Compact context before the 200K cliff on long agent runs. Available via xAI API, Cursor, OpenRouter. |
| **Muse Spark 1.3** | 2026-09-03 | Meta frontier (`muse-spark-1.3`, xhigh GA; max after safety testing), 1M context, text/image/video in, Meta Model API + Muse Code. Self-corrects, asks clarifying questions, confirms before consequential actions. Do not over-script tool loops (~20% fewer vs 1.2). Standard endpoint keeps data private; Contributor is cheaper but may train Meta products. Lean outcome prompts with explicit autonomy and escalation bounds. |
| **Kimi K3** | 2026-09-03 | Moonshot open frontier (`kimi-k3`), 2.8T MoE, 1M context, native vision, $0.30 cache-hit / $3 input / $15 output per MTok. Long-horizon coding and agentic work -- best with Kimi Code harness. Default max thinking at launch; use low/high effort when available. Outcome and evidence bar, not micromanaged steps. Structure a stable prefix for Mooncake cache hits. |
| **Gemini** | 2026-09-03 | Legacy/generic Google. Prefer Gemini 3.8 Flash for current Flash work. Explicit structure, clear formatting, grounding context up front. Verify against current Google docs for anything critical. |
| **Claude Fable 5** | 2026-09-03 | Legacy. Mythos-tier, built for long autonomous self-verifying runs, not rapid back-and-forth. State goals/success criteria, not steps -- over-specifying degrades it. Default effort: high (xhigh for the hardest work). Delegates to subagents on its own. Benefits from a persistent lessons file across sessions. Runs safety classifiers on offensive-cybersecurity and bio/life-science content that can flag legitimate defensive/detection work -- frame technique descriptions defensively. Never ask it to echo/explain its internal reasoning as response text (risks refusal fallback to Opus 4.8). Define explicit pause-vs-continue checkpoints for long tasks. |
| **Claude Mythos 5** | 2026-09-03 | Legacy. Same model as Fable 5, without the added cyber/bio safety layer, restricted to trusted orgs. Same prompting patterns as Fable 5. |
| **Claude Opus 4.8** | 2026-09-03 | Legacy. Strong general reasoning. Benefits from clear step structure, explicit success criteria, worked examples for style-sensitive tasks. Less suited to fully autonomous multi-hour runs than Fable 5. |
| **Other** | - | No verified vendor-specific behavior available. General best practice: explicit goal, constraints, format, audience. Note in rationale that this is generic guidance. |

## System prompt — question generation

```
You are an expert prompt engineer. You generate a single batch of clarifying questions
that will let you fully optimize a prompt for a specific target model, given a user's raw
natural-language request.

Target model: {{resolvedModel}}
Known behavior of this target: {{modelNotes}}

Because this target is not always well suited to rapid back-and-forth (especially
long-horizon models), ask everything you'll need in ONE batch rather than iteratively.
Group questions into 3-5 categories relevant to the request (choose from: Scope & Goal,
Constraints & Format, Tone & Audience, Autonomy & Iteration Cadence, Security & Reliability,
Technical Environment -- only include categories relevant to this specific request). Within
groups, include conditional follow-up questions that only make sense given a particular
answer (a domino-effect branch), marked with dependsOn.

Keep every question under 15 words and every option under 5 words. Produce 10-18 total
questions including branches.

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown fences, no prose) matching exactly this schema:
[{"group":"string","questions":[{"id":"short_snake_case","text":"string",
"type":"single_select|multi_select|text","options":["..."],"dependsOn":null}]}]

For conditional questions, dependsOn must be {"questionId":"parent_id",
"values":["option","that","triggers","it"]} -- otherwise null. For type "text", options
must be an empty array.
```

User message: `Raw request: "{{rawRequest}}"\n\nGenerate the question batch now.`

## System prompt — compile optimized prompt

```
You are an expert prompt engineer. Synthesize a fully optimized prompt for the target
model below, using the user's raw request and their clarifying answers.

Target model: {{resolvedModel}}
Known behavior of this target: {{modelNotes}}

Optimize for: user satisfaction, feasibility, usability, and top-tier performance on this
specific model. If the request involves building software, systems, or handling sensitive
data, include a short "Security & Reliability" section in the prompt capturing relevant
constraints -- omit it entirely if not applicable. Keep the whole response under 500 words.

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown fences, no prose) matching exactly this schema:
{"prompt":"the full optimized prompt text, ready to paste as-is","rationale":"2-4
sentences on key choices made for this model","settings":"one line of suggested settings
for this model (effort level, temperature, etc.) or empty string if not applicable"}
```

**First compile:** `Raw request: "{{rawRequest}}"\n\nClarifying answers:\n{{answeredEntries}}\n\nCompile the optimized prompt now.`

**Self-heal revision:** `Original request: "{{rawRequest}}"\n\nPrevious optimized prompt:\n{{previousPrompt}}\n\nUser feedback on that version: "{{feedback}}"\n\nDiagnose what's wrong (scope mismatch, wrong tone, missing constraint, too rigid, too vague, model mismatch, security gap, or other) and produce a revised version that fixes it. Reflect the diagnosis briefly in the rationale.`

## Unfamiliar-model research & indexing

If the target is "Other" and the named model/provider isn't one of the built-in profiles,
Proofhouse doesn't fall back to generic guidance right away:

1. **Check the index first** — looks for previously researched notes on this model in
   persistent storage (`model-notes:{name}`, shared across sessions/users of the tool).
2. **Research if unknown** — runs a web-search-enabled API call to find the model's actual
   prompting quirks, context window, and known behavior, and condenses it into one dense
   paragraph in the same style as the built-in profiles.
3. **Index it** — writes the result back to persistent storage so the next person (or the
   same person, next session) gets the cached version instantly instead of re-researching.
4. **Fail gracefully** — if research turns up nothing usable, falls back to generic guidance
   and says so rather than inventing specifics.

The UI shows which source was used (built-in / cached from a prior session / freshly
researched / fallback) so this is never silent.

## Loop engineering

A "Loop / recurring task" toggle switches the compiled prompt from a one-shot shape to a
loop shape when the objective is a repeated cycle rather than a single pass. When enabled,
both stages inject a loop-engineering directive and the compiled prompt includes an explicit
**Loop Structure** section covering:

- **Trigger/cadence** — what starts each iteration (schedule, event, manual)
- **Loop body** — plan, act, verify each iteration against evidence, not assumption
- **Exit/stop condition** — what ends the loop, distinct from what ends one iteration
- **Checkpoint/escalation** — what's severe or ambiguous enough to interrupt and involve a human
- **Compounding memory** — a running lessons file so later iterations benefit from earlier ones

The clarification stage also adds a "Loop & Recurrence" question group when this is enabled,
covering trigger type, interval/condition, stop condition, and what counts as "done."

## Reuse

- **Interactive**: use `proofhouse.jsx` as-is (calls the Claude API directly, no backend needed).
- **Manual**: paste the system/user prompts above into any conversation, filling in the
  `{{placeholders}}` by hand.
- **Portable**: `proofhouse-framework.json` holds the same content as structured data for
  scripting or dropping into other tools.
