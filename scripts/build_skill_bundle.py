"""Rebuild skills/proofhouse/proofhouse.skill from its source directory.

The bundle is a committed artifact, so it is packed reproducibly: entries sorted,
fixed timestamps and attributes, text normalised to LF, and stored uncompressed.

Two things would otherwise make the bytes depend on the machine that packed it.
.gitattributes pins eol=lf for .md but leaves .json and .jsx on text=auto, which
checks out CRLF on Windows and LF on Linux -- hence the LF normalisation. And
deflate output varies with the zlib version behind the running interpreter, so a
bundle packed on one Python differs byte-for-byte from the same bundle packed on
another even though the contents are identical -- hence ZIP_STORED. That is a
real trade: the bundle is roughly 75 KB stored against 28 KB deflated. It buys a
committed artifact that anyone can reproduce exactly, and git compresses the blob
in its object store regardless.

Run after changing anything under skills/proofhouse/. tests/test_skill_bundle.py
fails if the committed bundle and the source directory disagree.
