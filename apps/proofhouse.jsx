Drop redundant generic 'double-check your work' wording (it causes over-verification); keep every user-required test, acceptance check and approval gate. Cap subagent spawns; it delegates eagerly. Ask for concise progress explicitly; default replies run long. Constrain scope on large jobs or it will expand them. Step up to Fable 5.1 only when Opus 5 at higher effort still fails evals.",
