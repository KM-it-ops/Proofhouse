"""The committed skill bundle must match its source directory.

`skills/proofhouse/proofhouse.skill` is a zip of `skills/proofhouse/`, committed
as an artifact. It was hand-packed once and then drifted unnoticed for two
months, shipping framework v1.2 against a v1.3 source. These tests are the gate
that makes that impossible to repeat: the bundle is now built by
`scripts/build_skill_bundle.py`, and a stale bundle fails here.
